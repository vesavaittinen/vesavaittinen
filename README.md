# About me
## History
Hi! I grew up with computers back in the 80's and 90's. I was then mainly a user, though I started to do some basic programming (in basic!) by studying programming from various magazines and books.
In many cases it was manual copy paste, but I learned the principles of programming. I played with code and modified it, and the experience from it felt rewarding.

## Present time

As an adult I tried to search some way of earning a living, outside of all computers and programming, but I guess the circle came back to me since I got myself studying IT in the LAB University of Applied Sciences in 2023.
Sure there was a brief period of studying basic HTML and CSS in the early 2000's, when I studied Audio-visual Communications to become as a media-assistent, but that took me nowhere in terms of
employment, so I searched elsewhere for a different job.

Now I'm studying something that I always recognized to have been an inseparable part of me and what is my kind of a natural function, or so it feels like to me. Code is life. :)
